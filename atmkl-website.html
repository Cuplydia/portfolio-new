            <h2>The Challenge</h2>
            <div>
              <p>Designing Khalilah Lyons' first website presented a unique challenge and opportunity to capture her business acumen, goals, and personality as a Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Professional, while also reflecting her expertise as a Product Designer and Front-end Developer. As a visionary entrepreneur, Khalilah's website needed to effectively communicate her brand identity to potential clients and stakeholders. Here's how the design process likely unfolded:

                Understanding Khalilah's Vision:
                
                The initial phase involved comprehensive discussions and interviews with Khalilah to gain insight into her vision, goals, target audience, and brand identity.
                This allowed the design team to align the website's design and functionality with Khalilah's aspirations and objectives in promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion.
                
                <p><b>Translating Business Goals into Design Elements:</b></p>
                <p>With a clear understanding of Khalilah's business goals, the design team would have translated these objectives into tangible design elements.</p>
                <p>This may have included creating a user-friendly interface, incorporating interactive features, and ensuring a seamless user experience across devices to effectively engage visitors.</p>
                
                <p><b>Capturing Khalilah's Personality:</b></p>
                <p>Given Khalilah's unique background and expertise, the website's design aimed to capture her individual style, creativity, and professionalism.
                <p>Custom graphics, personalized messaging, and visually appealing layouts likely played a role in reflecting Khalilah's personality and expertise as a DEI Professional, Product Designer, and Front-end Developer.</p>
                
                <p><b>Balancing Design and Functionality:</b></p>
                <p>As a Product Designer and Front-end Developer, Khalilah likely emphasized both aesthetic appeal and functionality in the website design.</p>
                <p>Striking a balance between visually engaging design elements and practical features that enhance user experience and drive conversions would have been crucial.</p>
                
                <p><b>Iterative Design Process:</b></p>
                
                <p>Throughout the design process, the team engaged in an iterative approach, soliciting feedback from Khalilah and incorporating revisions to ensure the website met her expectations and requirements.</p>
                <p>This collaborative process facilitated alignment between Khalilah's vision and the final website design, ensuring it effectively communicated her brand identity and expertise.</p>
                <p>In summary, designing Khalilah Lyons' first website required a thoughtful and strategic approach to capture her business acumen, goals, and personality effectively. By understanding Khalilah's vision, translating business goals into design elements, capturing her personality, and balancing design and functionality, the design team was able to create a compelling and impactful website that reflects Khalilah's unique brand identity and expertise.</p>

            <h2>Planning & Discovery</h2>
            <div>
                <p>In our planning and analysis phase, our goal was to figure out who
                    would be coming to the website, what these users wanted / needed, and what features we should 
                    build. After we researching, planning, and meeting with our client, we created a list of features and
                    enhancements, which included:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Clarifying her message (who she is and what she does)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Conveying a feeling of empowerment, excellence, and excitement
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Highlighting her DEI presentations (videos, podcasts, public speaking)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Showcasing the list of Answer the Moment clientele

                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Methods</h3>
                <p>We analyzed Khaliliah's existing marketing materials (PowerPoint for clients, e-List, LinkedIn, etc.)-<br>
                    We analyzed similar DEI website like Jodi-Ann Burey (https://jodiannburey.com) -
                    to determine what was working and what wasn't.-<br>
                    Interviewed Khalilah (including developing an interview guide)<br>
                    <ul>
                    <li>
                        To get her input regarding what she was looking for in a website
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        To get a sense of her personality and a vision for how her website should be 
                        organized, what it should communicate
                    </li>    
                    <li>
                        To get a Sense of her brand and aesthetic tastes.

                        Conducting online research on her LinkedIn to get a sense of her content, her values, her brand and her consulting firm.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Methods</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Creating an interview guide
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Organizing and conducting needs assessment and feedback meetings, asking follow-up /

                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Defining Requirements</h3>
                <p>From our internet research / client interview, we created a list of requirements (which are
                    high-level tasks that the software should support). These included:
                    We learned who was in charge (lol)
                    Transferred her info to the new website. Looked at what we liked / didn't
                    like.
                    Divided up the tasks and created a design each.
                    Don't try and do everything you want to do - do their requirements first:
                    Equity Campaign (invest & donate on every page)
                    Timeline + Thermometer
                    Tenant Profiles
                    Got their 'buy-in' for modifications to their existing website.

                    We started with google slides to come up with ideas re: how we wanted the website to look.
                    Using Google slides, we created the first step for a plan of action for each page – what we wanted
                    each
                    page to say / be about and look like.
                    Shared out and discussed the designs.
                    Generated a lot of ideas quickly.

                    Trello – project management tool. Helps keep projects organized. And you know who’s doing what (we
                     didn't use this tool...but perhaps next time)?

                <p>After we came up with the designs / templates / widgets, we created the actual pages and posts, using
                    the content provided, and created a unified look and feel.</p>
                <h3>Methods</h3>
                <p>Designed the information architecture of the website (what is most important, less important).
                    Designed the communication and flow of the website.
                    Implemented the Wordpress site on a live server.</p>

            <h2>Evaluation</h2>
            <div>
                <p> After we created our V1 prototype, we sent our link to the client for feedback.

                <h3>Methods</h3>
                <p>Met / emailed with the client to presented our first version prototype
                    Compiled feedback
                    Created a list of next steps / follow-up tasks (collaboratively)
                </p>
                <p>We created three different versions of the website throughout our design process.</p>
                <h3>Version 1</h3>
                <p>After the first round of feedback, our client liked the structure of the website and our design
                    concept, but wanted more color and vibrancy.
                    Design: more color; made sure to follow the style guide.</p>
                <h3>Version 2</h3>
                <p>Timeline: taking critical feedback and creating new versions
                    Re-structured the news page to showcase different sections - press, featured and news
                    Fundraising – thermometer
                    Updated content / pics</p>
                <h3>Version 3</h3>
                <p>Managing the customers via nagging :). Putting fake info to prompt a response.
                    Quote “customer may not know what they want, but they definitely know what they don’t like”. So we
                    possibly can say we sketched different options for them to review, and adjust the directions every
                    time
                    we talk to them.</p>

            <h2>Deployment & Handoff</h2>
            <div>
                <p> To deploy the site, we helped the client sign up with a hosting
                    provider (GoDaddy) and exported /
                    imported the WordPress site to the live server. We also ensured that the
                    WordPress site was secure, that it was being
                    backed up, and that all images were uploaded to a cloud hosting provider. Finally, we created
                    training videos and a maintenance plan for the website handoff.

            <div>
                <p>I learned that Khalilah is her own brand.  Based on the pictures of herself on Social Media.  She liked vibrant colors.  Sophisticated.  Corporate aesthetic - simple:  not too frilly</p>
                <p>Values:  empowering women, emphasizing that DEI work isn't just a badge you get...or checking a box...it's a process.  It involves ongoing work.</p>
                <p>Willingness to collaborate/work with us. Was very open to our ideas, open to different ways of communicating.  Flexible and inclusive.  The fact that she came to us and left everything in our hands...she was willing to empower us to make decisions on her behalf.</p>
                <p>What did we learn about her goals:  to be an influcencer for positive change.  Wanted to make a difference in workplace settins and in other settings (e.g., changing culture more broadly to be more inclusive).</p>
                <p>Showed her values and commitment to th eprocess - so that she could find clients who were interested in dow the work</p>
