            <h2>The Challenge</h2>
            <div>
                <p>
                    The challenge of the responsive website using Bootstrap.  The goal was to create a widget to include in the not only client's power tools, but appliance hosted sites.   Also, to provide an opportunity making customers aware of additional Bosch products.                          
                    Widget is implemented as a web widget or web part-independent small web page which acts as a section of a main web page.

            <h2>Planning & Discovery</h2>
            <div>
                <p>In the planning and analysis phase, my goal was to figure out who
                    would be using the carousel, what these users wanted / needed, and what features we should we
                    build. After researching, planning, and reviewing other client's websites, we created a list of features and
                    enhancements, which included:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Clarifying their message (who they are and what they do)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Conveying a feeling of power, excellence, and excitement
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Highlighting the appliance features
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Showcasing the type of “Applicances”
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Telling the story / benefit purchasing applicances 
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Methods</h3>
                <p>We analyzed the existing Power Tool carousel and similar ones -<br>
                    like Home Depot - to determine what was working and what wasn't. <br>
                    Also looked at existing marketing materials
                    (e.g. website, videos, advertisements, media, etc.)
                    Interviewed potential internal customers - got the client's input regarding what
                    they were looking for, look and feel, timeline, communication style, etc.</p>
                <h3>Methods</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Creating an interview guide
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Organizing and conducting needs assessment and feedback meetings, asking follow-up /
                        clarifying questions, and
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Note-taking
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Debriefing / compiling the findings from the interview with the team.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Defining Requirements</h3>
                <p>From our internet research / client interview, we create a list of requirements (which are
                    high-level tasks that the software should support). These included:
                    We learned to use Bootstrap and Visual Studio to code (lol)
                    Looked at Microsoft SQL database transfer to Visual Studio; Looked at Asp.Net to reviewing file in local host. Looked at what we liked / didn't
                    like.
                    Managed coding task.
                    Don't try and do everything you want to do - do their requirements first:

                <p>Low-fidelity prototyping (Google Slides)
                    We started with Asp.Net to come up with ideas re: how we wanted the website to look.
                    Using Asp.Net and Microsoft SQL and created the first step for a plan of action – what we wanted
                    each
                    page to say / be about and look like.
                    Shared out and discussed the designs.
                    Generated a lot of ideas quickly.
                    Sharing and discussing design decisions with Architect

            <div>
                <p>After I came up with the designs / templates / carousel, I created the widget actual pages and posts, using
                    the content provided, and created a unified look and feel.</p>
                <h3>Methods</h3>
                <p>Designed the information architecture of the carousel (what is most important, less important).
                    Designed the communication and flow of the carousel.
                    Implemented the carousel site on a live server.</p>
                <h3>Description of the Process</h3>
                <p>Figuring out the skeleton and the order
                    What pictures to use
                    Shortened the content (b/c ppl usually skim websites versus reading all of the content)
                    Prepared to meet and get feedback.</p>

                <h3>Version 1</h3>
                <p>Managing the customers via nagging :). Putting fake info to prompt a response.
                    Quote “customer may not know what they want, but they definitely know what they don’t like”. So we
                    possibly can say we sketched different options for them to review, and adjust the directions every
                    time we talk to them.</p>
