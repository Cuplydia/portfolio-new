            <h2>The Challenge</h2>
            <div>
                <p>
                    The challenge of the Bootstrap Carousel was creating a widget in the SQL database and Asp.NET tool.  The goal was to create a widget to include in the not only client's power tools, but appliance hosted sites.   Also, to provide an opportunity making customers aware of additional Bosch products.                          
                    Widget is implemented as a web widget or web part-independent small web page which acts as a section of a main web page.

            <h2>Planning & Discovery</h2>
            <div>
                <p>In the planning and analysis phase, my goal was to figure out who
                    would be using the carousel, what these users wanted / needed, and what features we should we
                    build. After researching, planning, and reviewing other client's websites, we created a list of features and
                    enhancements, which included:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Clarifying their message (who they are and what they do)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Conveying a feeling of power, excellence, and excitement
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Highlighting the appliance features
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Showcasing the type of “Applicances”
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Telling the story / benefit purchasing applicances 
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Methods</h3>
                <p>We analyzed the existing Power Tool carousel and similar ones -<br>
                    like Home Depot - to determine what was working and what wasn't. <br>
                    Also looked at existing marketing materials
                    (e.g. website, videos, advertisements, media, etc.)
                    Interviewed potential internal customers - got the client's input regarding what
                    they were looking for, look and feel, timeline, communication style, etc.</p>
                <h3>Methods</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Creating an interview guide
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Organizing and conducting needs assessment and feedback meetings, asking follow-up /
                        clarifying questions, and
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Note-taking
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Debriefing / compiling the findings from the interview with the team.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Defining Requirements</h3>
                <p>From our internet research / client interview, we create a list of requirements (which are
                    high-level tasks that the software should support). These included:
                    We learned to use Bootstrap and Visual Studio to code (lol)
                    Looked at Microsoft SQL database transfer to Visual Studio; Looked at Asp.Net to reviewing file in local host. Looked at what we liked / didn't
                    like.
                    Managed coding task.
                    Don't try and do everything you want to do - do their requirements first:

                    We started with Asp.Net to come up with ideas re: how we wanted the website to look.
                    Using Asp.Net and Microsoft SQL and created the first step for a plan of action – what we wanted
                    each
                    page to say / be about and look like.
                    Shared out and discussed the designs.
                    Generated a lot of ideas quickly.
